## Usage Instructions
### Note: Test chatting by anonymous browser because I am using cookies to maintain user login.

1.  **Enter a username and press "Login" or the Enter key.**

(The system will display an error message if the username is already in use)

2.  **Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the Online List page,** which displays a list of currently online users.

(This list automatically updates as users come online or log out.)

3.  **When another user comes online, click on their name to start a chat session.** You can then exchange messages.

The system automatically maintains login status for one day (via cookies). If the server is not restarted, users can continue their sessions and chat as normal.

4. **After chatting, you can click the "Back" button (top-left corner) to return to the Online List.**

5. **To log out, click the "Logout" button (top-right corner).**
